**Integrating code and text:**

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

```

**Inserting Images:**

The image below is the epidemiological triad. This model is used to understand the complexity of infectious diseases. Rather than just explaining a disease as being the cause of a pathogen on the host, it involves the environment as a factor as well. Showing how the three factors (host, pathogen, and environment) interact to cause disease.

**Sample size for disease detection:**

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

Answer 1) The sample size necessary to detect disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer is to sample from 59 deer.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer 2)

A\) To be 95% confident in detecting disease being 1% prevalent in a large population you would need to sample 299 animals within the overall population. This is for populations such as in the wild. If you have a better estimate of the total population size you would be able to determine a more clear sample size to test. For example if you wanted to be 95% confident the disease is prevalent at 1% in a population around 10000, you would need to sample 298 animals.

B\) To be 99% confident in detecting disease being 2% prevalent in a large population you would need to sample 229 animals within the overall population. This is for populations such as in the wild. If you have a better estimate of the total population size you would be able to determine a more clear sample size to test. For example if you wanted to be 99% confident the disease is prevalent at 2% in a population around 5000, you would need to sample 224 animals.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

Answer 3) Using the rule of 3's you can be 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in the facility is \<1%

**Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence**

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

![](images/clipboard-143554262.png)

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

Answer a):

-   On day 6/12: 5 new elk observed with RE, OD; 51 total susceptible...5/51= 0.098 cases per elk-day

-   On day 6/14: 2 new elk observed with RE, OD; 44 total susceptible...2/44= 0.045 cases per elk-day

-   On day 6/15: 0 new elk observed with RE or OD, so incidence of new cases is 0 cases per elk-day

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

Answer b):

-   On day 6/13: 13 elk are infected, the total population is 56...13/56= 0.214 so 23.2% prevalence of conjunctivitis

-   On day 6/16: 5 elk are infected, the total population is 56...5/56= 0.089 so 8.9% prevalence of conjunctivitis

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

Answer c):

-   6/10: Prevalence- 1/56= 0.18; Incidence- 0.18

-   No other days have the same prevalence and same incidence.

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest?

Answer d):

-   The days with the lowest incidence are days 6/15 & 6/16 with 0 new cases, followed by day 6/13 with 0.043 cases per elk-day

-   6/10: 1/56= 0.018

-   6/11: 4/55= 0.073

-   6/12: 5/51= 0.098

-   6/13: 2/46= 0.043

-   6/14: 2/44= 0.045

-   6/15: 0

-   6/16: 0

## 10/17/2025-Lab Report #1

**Tick Identification Lab**

Tick identification follows the flow of life stage, sex, genus and then species. To start identification of the life stage (larva, nymph, or adult) you count the number of legs. Larvae have six legs, while nymphs and adults have eight. Sex is then determined by distinguishing the scutum, the back plate of ticks. Males have a full scutum covering the whole dorsal side (conscutum) while females have a smaller scutum (alloscutum). The alloscutum of females is smaller, so that it can expand while feeding. So, if you find a dog on a dog with a large expanded back it is either a female or nymph. Genus identification of ticks relies on the position of the anal groove. This groove in *Ixodes* is located in front of the anal opening, while most other ticks such as *Dermacentor* and *Amblyomma* have anal grooves that are behind the anus. Typically to determine species further, you would use a dichotomous key. However, the SAM method–scutum, anal groove, and mouthparts-provides a quick guide for reference. Longer mouthparts indicate species of *Amblyomma* species. While shorter mouthparts suggest the species will be *Dermacentor* or *Rhipicephalus.* Accurate tick identification is vital for public health. Ticks are the number one vectors for a variety of zoonotic diseases, such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Correctly identifying tick species aids public health in providing information to have vector control strategies in place and be better prepared to treat patients with tick borne infections.
