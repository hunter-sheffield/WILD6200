**Integrating code and text:**

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

```

**Inserting Images:**

The image below is the epidemiological triad. This model is used to understand the complexity of infectious diseases. Rather than just explaining a disease as being the cause of a pathogen on the host, it involves the environment as a factor as well. Showing how the three factors (host, pathogen, and environment) interact to cause disease.
