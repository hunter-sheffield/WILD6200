**Inserting Images:**

The image below is the epidemiological triad. This model is used to understand the complexity of infectious diseases. Rather than just explaining a disease as being the cause of a pathogen on the host, it involves the environment as a factor as well. Showing how the three factors (host, pathogen, and environment) interact to cause disease.

**Sample size for disease detection:**

![](images/clipboard-1758138076.png)

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

Answer 1) The sample size necessary to detect disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer is to sample from 59 deer.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer 2)

A\) To be 95% confident in detecting disease being 1% prevalent in a large population you would need to sample 299 animals within the overall population. This is for populations such as in the wild. If you have a better estimate of the total population size you would be able to determine a more clear sample size to test. For example if you wanted to be 95% confident the disease is prevalent at 1% in a population around 10000, you would need to sample 298 animals.

B\) To be 99% confident in detecting disease being 2% prevalent in a large population you would need to sample 229 animals within the overall population. This is for populations such as in the wild. If you have a better estimate of the total population size you would be able to determine a more clear sample size to test. For example if you wanted to be 99% confident the disease is prevalent at 2% in a population around 5000, you would need to sample 224 animals.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

Answer 3) Using the rule of 3's you can be 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in the facility is \<1%

**Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence**

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

![](images/clipboard-143554262.png)

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

Answer a):

-   On day 6/12: 5 new elk observed with RE, OD; 51 total susceptible...5/51= 0.098 cases per elk-day

-   On day 6/14: 2 new elk observed with RE, OD; 44 total susceptible...2/44= 0.045 cases per elk-day

-   On day 6/15: 0 new elk observed with RE or OD, so incidence of new cases is 0 cases per elk-day

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

Answer b):

-   On day 6/13: 13 elk are infected, the total population is 56...13/56= 0.214 so 23.2% prevalence of conjunctivitis

-   On day 6/16: 5 elk are infected, the total population is 56...5/56= 0.089 so 8.9% prevalence of conjunctivitis

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

Answer c):

-   6/10: Prevalence- 1/56= 0.18; Incidence- 0.18

-   No other days have the same prevalence and same incidence.

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest?

Answer d):

-   The days with the lowest incidence are days 6/15 & 6/16 with 0 new cases, followed by day 6/13 with 0.043 cases per elk-day

-   6/10: 1/56= 0.018

-   6/11: 4/55= 0.073

-   6/12: 5/51= 0.098

-   6/13: 2/46= 0.043

-   6/14: 2/44= 0.045

-   6/15: 0

-   6/16: 0

**Tick Identification Lab**

Tick identification follows the flow of life stage, sex, genus and then species. To start identification of the life stage (larva, nymph, or adult) you count the number of legs. Larvae have six legs, while nymphs and adults have eight. Sex is then determined by distinguishing the scutum, the back plate of ticks. Males have a full scutum covering the whole dorsal side (conscutum) while females have a smaller scutum (alloscutum). The alloscutum of females is smaller, so that it can expand while feeding. So, if you find a dog on a dog with a large expanded back it is either a female or nymph. Genus identification of ticks relies on the position of the anal groove. This groove in *Ixodes* is located in front of the anal opening, while most other ticks such as *Dermacentor* and *Amblyomma* have anal grooves that are behind the anus. Typically to determine species further, you would use a dichotomous key. However, the SAM method–scutum, anal groove, and mouthparts-provides a quick guide for reference. Longer mouthparts indicate species of *Amblyomma* species. While shorter mouthparts suggest the species will be *Dermacentor* or *Rhipicephalus.* Accurate tick identification is vital for public health. Ticks are the number one vectors for a variety of zoonotic diseases, such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Correctly identifying tick species aids public health in providing information to have vector control strategies in place and be better prepared to treat patients with tick borne infections.

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Incorrect; MERS-CoV is not primarily maintained in humans. Humans are incidental hosts that become infected through close contact with dromedary camels. It is only transmitted to humans through spillover events.
2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Correct, Camels are the main reservoir for MERS-CoV
3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Correct; Humans infected with MERS-CoV typically are not able to spread it to other humans. Although there has been limited documentation of human-to-human transmission, the virus does not efficiently sustain in human populations
4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Incorrect; the case fatality rate is around 35%
5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Incorrect; the epidemic curve shows this is propagated outbreak. There has been continuous transmission overtime, but most likely from different sources.

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units. ​

​1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

[Answer:]{.underline} Based on the Fenton and Pedersen framework the Marburg virus outbreak can be classified as a spillover event then leading into an emerging infectious disease. To begin with, the outbreak began as a spillover event. It was transmitted from bats to one person who visited a bat cave, the Marburg virus naturally lives within bat populations but typically does not spread into humans. Once the first person was infected the virus had to the opportunity to spread from person to person, therefore becoming a potential emerging infectious disease.

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

[Answer:]{.underline} In the community measures implemented to reduce the risk of transmission would be public education of where the virus originates from. So explaining to people that being around bats or in enclosed areas where bats live (ex: the cave from where the Rwanda outbreak began) poses as a serious risk of being infected with Marburg. Another measure could be surveillance of bat populations to track how the virus is spreading and if it appears in locations not seen before. For healthcare settings, since the virus can spread from person to person via secretions having proper quarantined areas for patients with possible infection is a very important measure. It is also important for healthcare workers to wear proper PPE to prevent infections of themselves and proper hygiene practices, such as handwashing and ensuring areas patients come in contact with are disinfected (bedding, gowns, ect.).

A new disease, *Vertico*, has been detected in fish in two separate ponds. Your task is to analyze the sample data to determine and compare the disease prevalence between the two ponds.

Data: Prevalence data for fish in 2 ponds: 0 indicates uninfected and 1 indicates infected fish.

<https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/blob/main/pond1_trial.csv>

<https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/blob/main/pond2_trial.csv>

For each pond, report the following: Prevalence (%), 95% CI (%), Fisher’s exact test *p*-value, and Interpretation (Is the difference statistically significant?).

**Pond 1:**

![](images/clipboard-1559762459.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Prevalence: 30%
2.  95% CI: 14%-53%

**Pond 2:**

![](images/clipboard-2694105833.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Prevalence: 6.7%
2.  95% CI: 3%-30%

**Pond 1 vs Pond 2 Prevalence using Fisher's exact test:**

![](images/clipboard-917827692.png){fig-align="center"}

Interpretation: From Fisher's exact test a p-value of 0.1987 is found. A p-value greater than 0.05 indicates the data from the two ponds is not statistically significant. The observed difference between the prevalence of *Vertico* in the two ponds (30% and 6.7%) is most likely due to random sampling variation of the fish rather than true differences in *Vertico* infection rates.

**Nipah Virus**

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

[**Answer:**]{.underline} In both countries fruit bats are the natural reservoir hosts. The mode of transmission in Malaysia is mediated through commercial pigs. Pigs became amplifying hosts of the virus, building up high viral loads which then began spreading through respiratory droplets specifically on farms. Humans cases typically were pig farmers, processing workers or others with exposure to pigs. In Bangladesh however, there is direct bat to human transmission and human to human. This transmission pathway is linked to the consumption of raw date palm sap that has been contaminated with the fruit bat urine or saliva. Human to human transmission is typically in close contact areas such as hospitals due to inadequate infection control procedures. Because the virus spreads via pigs in Malaysia it is important to have proper biosecurity measures, cull infected herds and ensure proper hygiene/PPE for farm and processing workers. Controlling the intermediate host (pigs) breaks the viral cycle and limits chances of human infections. In Bangladesh, prevention requires human behavior changes (consuming boiled rather than raw sap) and strengthening surveillance of human infections as well as healthcare hygiene.

**Avian Reovirus**

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

[**Answer:**]{.underline} Avian reoviruses spread rapidly among poultry flocks and wild bird populations through three routes: 1. Fecal-Oral: birds shed the virus in feces and other birds become infected by ingesting contaminated feed, water or litter; 2. Aerosols: the virus in dust particles or dried fecal matter get aerosolized and infect other birds which is very common in crowded poultry houses; 3. Vertical: infected hens can transmit the virus directly into the egg which results in infection of the chick before even hatching. There are several environmental factors that favor the transmission of ARV. Crowded poultry production houses increases fecal and aerosol spread, along with poor litter quality playing a role in this transmission. Flocks (or wild birds) sharing water sources can also be an efficient fecal oral transmission of the virus. Environmental stability of the virus plays a large role in its fecal-oral transmission, as it can persist in the litter, soil, and feces for weeks to months. ARV is a non-enveloped RNA virus, making it more resistant to disinfectants, drying, fluctuating temperatures, and acidic pH environments. One example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV is winter mortality in crows. During winter large numbers of crows gather together to roosts to provide them warmth, however this enhances the viruses ability to infect the birds and ultimately leads to a large number of crow deaths.

**Langya henipavirus**

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

[**Answer:**]{.underline} Current evidence shows the primary natural reservoir of LayV is shrews, with around 27% percent of shrews surveillanced showing high viral RNA associated with the virus. Humans are most likely to become infected with LayV through direct or indirect contact with the infected shrews. Most cases of human infections have been in farmers or individuals with frequent animal exposure. These patients most likely became infected from the bodily fluids of the shrews around their crops (saliva, urine, blood, feces). In rare cases, domestic animals (goats and dogs) have been a possible link from wildlife to human cases, however these cases are very few in number and the testing of the domestic animals showed low seropositivity for the virus. LayV is considered a zoonotic spillover and not an EID due to having no sustained human to human transmission. Currently, cases have all be sporadic and associated with certain geographical locations (on farms/rural areas in China). There has been no epidemiological clusterings of the virus in humans, even when patients are in close contacts with other members of their family, further suggesting humans as dead-end hosts.

## 11/19/2025-Worksheet #8

Examination of raccoon roundworm (*Baylisascaris procyonis*), a nematode worm found in the course of necropsies of 61 raccoons collected in Missouri and Arkansas during 2013 and 2014.

Data source: <https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/blob/main/WS7_data.csv>

Some background on *B. procyonis*:

-   Raccoon's are definitive hosts.

-   Adult worms reside in the raccoon intestine where they lay eggs which pass out of the host in the feces. These eggs may then be transmitted to other raccoons or to non-raccoon hosts.

-   In paratenic or accidental hosts (including humans), eggs hatch to larvae, and larval stages of the nematode migrate, and cause damage to nervous-system tissues, resulting in morbidity & mortality. See e.g.: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3285578.pdf>

-   As a risk to humans, wildlife, and domestic animals there is a need to better understand the ecology of this parasite

The dataset is comprised of information collected on 61 raccoons, each of which was necropsied and the number of roundworms counted. For each host there is data on the date of capture, the region (North, Central and South), the sex (male, female) and the age (adult, young adult). The last column gives the number of worms found during necropsy. Zero (0) worms indicates the raccoon was not found to be infected. Note that the necropsy data is real.

You have to analyze and summarize this data. Identify the patterns that emerge and use the available data to explain the patterns. Analyze this dataset to determine prevalence patterns and perform meaningful comparisons between different groups. For example, you can compare prevalence of *B. procyonis* between the three regions, between males and females in each region, between age classes in each region, etc. Please show your work, use Quantitative Parasitology for your calculations and comparisons. Provide confidence intervals for prevalence estimates. Finally, explain your analysis of this real-world data.

1.  [Regional comparisons:]{.underline}

Based upon region: Data sets–number of worms detected per region:

<https://github.com/hunter-sheffield/WILD6200/blob/main/Central_worms.csv>

<https://github.com/hunter-sheffield/WILD6200/blob/main/North_worms.csv>

<https://github.com/hunter-sheffield/WILD6200/blob/main/South_worms.csv>

Central–

![N= 14 total raccoons examined](images/clipboard-936761155.png)

9 were infected

Prevalence of *B. procyonis* is 64%; using Sterne's exact method with a 95% confidence level, the confidence intervals for prevalence ranged from 37% to 85%. Indicating true prevalence may vary due to the smaller sample size observed, however infection does appear to be relatively high in the Central region.

North–

![](images/clipboard-869290641.png)

N= 49 raccoons examined

14 were infected

Prevalence of *B. procyonis* is 29%; using Sterne's exact method with a 95% confidence level, the confidence intervals for prevalence ranged from 17% to 43%. Infection does occur in this region but is notably lower than what is observed in the Central region. The narrower confidence interval is due to the large sample size from the North region.

South–

![N= 43 raccoons were examined](images/clipboard-4019396605.png)

27 were infected

Prevalence of *B. procyonis* is 63%; using Sterne's exact method with a 95% confidence level, the confidence intervals for prevalence ranged from 48% to 76%. This indicates a relatively high level of infection of the raccoons in the Southern region.

[Comparison of Prevalence Among Regions:]{.underline}

To explore the variations in geographic location in *B. procynois* infection of raccoons, I compared the prevalence across the Central, North, and South regions by using Fisher's exact test. Prevalences differed significantly amongst the three regions. Fisher's exact test resulted in a p-value of 0.0016, well below 0.05. This indicates prevalence of the infection is not evenly distributed across the three regions. These findings suggests other ecological factors (for example raccoon population sizes) play a role in transmission and persistence of the parasitic infection.

![](images/clipboard-418982423.png)

2.  [Age Group Analysis:]{.underline}

Data sets-number of worms for each age group (young adults and adults)

<https://github.com/hunter-sheffield/WILD6200/blob/main/Adult_worms.csv>

<https://github.com/hunter-sheffield/WILD6200/blob/main/YoungAdult_worms.csv>

Adults:

N= 69 adult raccoons were examined

36 of those were observed to be infected

![](images/clipboard-92650465.png)The prevalence of *B. procyonis* is 52% in adult raccoons examined at a confidence level of 95% with confidence intervals ranged from 40% to 64%.

Young Adults:

N= 37 young adult raccoons examined

14 of those were observed to be infected

![](images/clipboard-3747965880.png)

The prevalence of *B. procyonis* is 34% with the same confidence level above and intervals ranging from 23% to 54%.

[Comparison of Prevalence Among Regions:]{.underline}

To explore the differences between adults and young adults infected by *B. procynois,* I compared the prevalence across the two groups using Fisher's exact test. Prevalence differed among the age groups, however no statistical significance was observed. Fisher's exact test resulted in a p-value of 0.2206. This indicates prevalence of the infection is most likely evenly distributed across the age groups.

![](images/clipboard-2447802247.png)

[**Overall Analysis of the Data:**]{.underline}

From this analysis of *B. procyonis* infections of raccoons a few assumptions can be made. Firstly, regions showed a clear difference in infections, with the North having significantly less detected worms from the sampled raccoons than the Central or Southern region. This could be due to various ecological factors such as less environmental contamination with infective eggs (may not survive as well in the colder/dryer climates) or even raccoon behaviors (movements of groups of raccoons who are infected to areas with raccoons who are not). Age also showed a trend of higher cases in adult raccoons, however these results were not statistically significant. This could be due to the fact that adult raccoons were more abundant in the examination than young adult raccoons. It also could be assumed that since adults have lived longer, their chances of being infected were much higher. However, it is evident age does not play a large role in infection, across the spectrum *B. procyonis* is capable of infection no matter the age of the raccoon. To fully understand the true ecological drivers behind these patterns more studies would need ot be conducted.

1.  In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

    [**Answer:**]{.underline} In the 2024 outbreak of *Salmonella* linked to backyard poultry flocks, investigators discovered many of the infections were due to human behaviors of the flock owners. Many backyard flock owners have chickens as their pets rather than for production uses. So oftentimes owners will pet and snuggle up next to the chickens, especially children. Owners also disregard washing their hands after touching the birds, their litter, or being in their coops and then touch their faces or handle foods which facilitates the zoonotic transmission since *Salmonella* spreads via fecal-oral route. Another way human behaviors can be attributed to this outbreak is the lack of biosecurity measures you would have on production farm. Often, backyard bird owners will not use separate clothing or boots when taking care of their flocks. So, if they come in contact with *Salmonella* while walking around their yards (free range birds) or in the coops, then go into their homes they risk the potential of spreading the bacteria inside. Since majority of the cases were in children under five, it is likely that the kids picked up the *Salmonella* while playing on the floor with toys (or even outside playing) and then not properly washing their hands before eating. While this outbreak was not clearly linked to any specific cause, the potential factor that lead to the outbreak was from hatcheries. Although it would be hard for owners to know if the chicks they are purchasing have pathogenic *Salmonella,* since the birds would not necessarily show signs. Another potential factor that could have lead to this outbreak is the purchase of these birds from large retail companies. Retail companies (including their hatcheries) often do not have strict biosecurity measures. So purchasing chicks from these businesses poses as a great risk for the introduction of pathogens into backyard flocks and ultimately the owners homes.

2.  Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (*Epichloë coenophiala*) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

    a\. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal\
    endophyte?

    b\. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?

    c\. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

    [**Answer:**]{.underline}

    A. *Epichloë coenophiala* is a symbiotic fungus that lives within the mycelium of tall fescue and is transmitted to fescue progeny vertically during seed production. This disease system is a well characterized example of mutualism. During seed production the fungus produces a variety of bioactive alkaloids which provide many advantages to the host grass including drought tolerance, improved stress tolerance in poor soil conditions, and better survivability under environmental stressors. All of these factors make the endophyte infected tall fescue much hardier and more persistent, making it a great foraging plant for livestock.

    B. There are many different environmental and ecological factors driving fescue toxicosis in grazing animals. Typically the severity of toxicosis tends to increase when the grass is allowed to fully mature while under heat or drought stress or under conditions where intensive grazing is prolonged. One of the reasons for this being that it allows for the ergot alkaloids to become more concentrated. When the fungus produces large amounts of these alkaloids, higher toxin levels are associated. While the endophyte supports the fescue plant toleration of drought and nutrient poor soils, paradoxically, under those stressors it drives an increase production of alkaloids more likely leading to toxicity in grazing animals. Environmental conditions for the animals also plays a large role in toxicosis. The alkaloids cause vasoconstriction, reduction of blood flow to extremities. In combination with this vasoconstriction, in hot drought weather or extremely cold temperatures, the animals struggle to thermoregulate from reduced circulation leading to tissue damages.

    C. Grazing livestock exhibit a multitude of signs associated with endophyte fescue toxicosis. Key clinical features are associated with impaired thermoregulation and reduced performance. These can include reduced feed intake (poor weight gain or weight loss), reduced fertility rates due to poor reproductive performance, decreased milk production, heat stress, and in some extreme cases a condition called fescue foot (gangrene of the hooves and legs of animals).

## 11/25/2025-Worksheet #10

1.  What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

    [**Answer:**]{.underline} ASFV is spread between wild and domestic pigs through main routes, playing a role in its spread across the world. Viral particles shed in secretions such as blood, saliva or urine and direct contact with these are the primary transmission routes between wild boar and domestic pigs. The virus is also very hardy and can survive long periods on equipment, in pens, and production worker clothing. These fomites can lead to new pigs introduced to farms being infected. In some areas of Africa biological transmission via soft ticks has also been documents. These ticks act as both reservoirs and vectors for the virus, spreading infection when blood feeding on production pigs or wild pigs. There are no known cases of human infections with ASFV, but play a large role in transmission of the virus. Besides production workers spreading the virus via fomites on farms, hunters of wild boar can increase transmission rates. Moving and field dressing wild pigs can leave infected remains in the environment which can then persist and introduce the virus to new pig populations.

2.  Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

    [**Answer**]{.underline}: Like human retrovirus, HIV, the Koala retrovirus, KoRV, dysregulates the immune system of the animals, making them more suspectible to Chlamydia infections. Co-infection of both these pathogens increases the chances of developing more severe urogenital, ocular, and reproductive diseases since the immune system of the koalas is impaired and unable to fully fight off the bacterial infection. This decreased immune system function also complicates management of chlymadiosis in the animals. Veterinarians must properly balance antibiotic treatment with the koalas weakened immune system.

3.  Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by *Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola*, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America.

    What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)?

    [**Answer**]{.underline}: Snake Fungal Disease is difficult to manage due to the nature of snakes. Typically snakes are fearful of human encounters and live in more discreet locations. This makes monitoring of snake populations challenging to understand the true prevalence of infection or detect early cases. Furthermore, clinical signs are variable and nonspecific, requiring special testing such as histopathology or qPCR which can be costly and not widely available for large scale surveillance mechanisms. The fungus has a very wide host range and can persist in the environment. This limits treating individuals and decreases the likelihood of eradication. Early detection, population management and conservation planning for affected snakes is greatly hindered by these factors.

## 12/4/2025-Final Exam

1\. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect

a\. Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and no within–target species transmission will be termed a spillover.

[**Answer(1a):**]{.underline} False, a pathogen with high between species transmission and no within target species transmission would be more closely identified as an apperant multi-host pathogen. Since the pathogen has a high chance of spreading between H1 and H2, but does not sustain within H2. An example of this would be rabies between domestic dogs and side-striped jackals in Africa. A spillover would be a disease with low in between species transmission.

b\. A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious. 

[**Answer(1b):**]{.underline} False, a viral disease that requires a vector to be transmitted to host and does not have the ability to be spread directly between hosts would be infectious but not contagious. Such as ticks spreading lyme disease, for a host to be infected it must be spread from the tick vector but it can not be transmitted directly from one host to another.

c\. The eggs of *Baylisascaris procyonis* can be transmitted to humans by direct contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon.

[**Answer(1c):**]{.underline} False, *Baylisascaris procyonis* eggs can only be transmitted between 2-4 weeks after excretion by raccoons to humans or other animals. The eggs must embryonate in the environment, forming into a larvae, before they become infectious.

d\. A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production.

[**Answer(1d):**]{.underline} True, but only if the cattle develops toxicosis from intake of large amounts of Epichloe coenophiala in the fescue grass. This fungus produces ergot alkaloids within the fescue plant that can cause fescue toxicosis leading to reduced feed intake, poor weight gain, and lower milk production. However, the presence of the fungus alone does not lead to this toxicosis, the toxins are the main driver. The toxin productions are increased by the fungus due to various environmental conditions (heat, drought stress, and plant maturity).

e\. Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus. 

[**Answer(1e):**]{.underline} False, northern cardinals are considered supersuppressors for WNV. They can get infected through feeding of vector mosquitoes, but the virus is not very effective of amplication within their blood, causing less viral loads within the cardinals ([Levine, 2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5094236/).

2\. List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections?

[**Answer(2):**]{.underline} There are several community based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Effective interventions targets all aspects of the Guinea worm life cycle to disrupt the transmission cycle. Guinea worms can begin their infectious cycle as L3 larvae in intermediate copepod hosts (water fleas). These larvae containing copepods are then ingested by humans in unfiltered water or by eating undercooked infected aquatic animals. So the most important community intervention strategy is to provide safe drinking water. This can been done in many ways such as protected wells to prevent consumption of stagnant water or providing filters such as LifeStraw which remove copepods containing L3 larvae, preventing direct ingestion of larvae. Along with this, proper food safety education methods can be used to teach people the dangers of eating raw or undercooked aquatic animals. Health education also plays a large role in prevention strategies, specifically exolaining the dangers of infected people from entering water sources. Dracunculiasis worms in infected individuals emerge from their hosts to release L1 larvae in the prescence of water. So preventing people who are infected emerging the blister caused by the fertilized female worm stops the discharge of larvae into the environment. Larvicide application to ponds and stagnant water sources can be used to kill copepods. Once the L1 larvae are released into the environment they are consumed by copepods. By using larvicide to kill the copepods/larvae, the parasite is prevented entirely from beginning its life cycle within the intermediate host. Since infection rates in other animals such as dogs have increased overtime further strategies have been implemented to stop the transmission cycle. When dogs are infected, owners are taught to tether the infected animal so that it will not seek to emerge the blisters in water, preventing the release of larvae. Along with this, it is important for owners to discourage dogs from consuming raw aquatic animals and potentially infected water. Altogether these intervention methods can block the life cycle of Guinea worm, preventing human and animal infections.

3\. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD?

[**Answer(3):**]{.underline} Like many wildlife diseases, wildlife agencies face many major obstacles in managment of CWD due to infected cervids being very difficult to detect. Infectious prions from the animals are shed for longer than 16 months during the incubation phase, without the cervids showing any signs of disease. This allows for prions to continously be silently transmitted into the environment. In the environment prions are not degraded quickly, persisting in the soil and organic matter for years making indirect transmission disruption and elimination of the disease even harder. There are also currently no vaccine or treatment methods or logistical ways to even implement them if they did exist. Further, hunting restrictions are also typically not accepted by many people. Since the virus can be spread through infected animal products (urine, saliva, feces) implementing strategies such as baiting and urine-based product bans could potentially be effective. However, very few of these managment and control strategies have been implemented or assessed. Overall due to the hardiness of prions and lack of community support, once CWD is detected in a population it has been well established furthering the difficulties of control long-term.

4\. You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos monitored at sampling stations (no capture required). At the start of the study (December 2024) none were infected with *Mycobacterium leprae*. During the follow-up period, monthly assessments documented the following counts of infected animals in the population:

-    March 2025: 3 infected

-   April 2025: 5 infected

-   May 2025: 5 infected

-    June 2025: 8 infected

-   July 2025: 13 infected

(No deaths, births, immigration, or recovery occurred during the study.)

a\. Calculate the monthly incidence of *M. leprae* infection. Show your calculations and state the units.

[**Answer(4a):**]{.underline} Incidence rate = \# of new cases/total population

-   March: 3/60= 0.05 per armadillo-month

-   April: 2/57= 0.035 per armadillo-month

-   May: 0/52= 0 per armadillo-month

-   June: 3/55= 0.055 per armadillo-month

-   July: 5/52= 0.096 per armadillo-month

b\. Which month had the highest prevalence? Which month had the lowest prevalence? Show your calculations and state the units.

[**Answer(4b):**]{.underline} Prevalence= total \# cases/total population

Lowest prevalence was March, Highest prevalence was July. There was no prevalence change between April to May due to no new cases being detected.

-   March: 3/60= 5%

-   April: 5/60= 8.3%

-   May: 5/60= 8.3%

-   June: 8/60= 13.3%

-   July: 13/60= 21.7%

5\. A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia. 

a\. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers?

[**Answer(5a):**]{.underline} *Francisella tularensis* subspecies Type B *holartica*

b\. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent?

[**Answer(5b):**]{.underline} Type B subspecies is associated with waterborne and aquatic transmission cycles. There are many different routes of transmission including ingestion of contaminated water from rivers, ponds or wetlands. The bacteria also has direct modes of transmission with contact of infected aquatic animals or their carcasses, and also through contamination of skin wounds. *F. tularensis* can also be vectorborne, where mosquitoes act as biological or mechanical vectors spreading between hosts. However, vector borne transmission is oftentimes of Type A rather than Type B.

c\. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/public health.

[**Answer(5c):**]{.underline} *F. tularensis* subspecies Type B has a very low infectious dose (10-50 organisms), making it highly transmissible. Therefore, it has been classified as a potential bioterrorism pathogen that can cause a multitude of diseases (ulceroglandular, pneumonic, typhoidal). The pathogens wide host range and environmental persistence also makes it difficult for controlling spreads to human population. The bacteria can survive within many different hosts like mammals, birds, arthropods and other aquatic species. It is also a very hardy bacteria that can persist in water, mud, or animal carcasses for weeks to months.

e.  Bell’s palsy, Bulls-eye rash                             5. *Pseudogymnoascus destructans* 6. African Swine Fever 

[**Answer(6):**]{.underline} 1-C, 2-A, 3-E, 4-B, 5-A, 6-D

-   Fungal pathogen of conservation concern = *Pseudogymnoascus & Ophidiomyces*

-   Avian Vacuolar Myelinopathy = Aetokthonotoxin

-   Tick-transmitted viral disease = Powassan encephalitis

-   Foreign Animal Disease = African Swine Fever

-    Bell’s palsy, Bulls-eye rash = *Borrelia burgdorferi*

7\. Refer to the life cycle of blacklegged tick to answer 7a – 7d.

8\. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s whitetailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance.

[**Answer(8):**]{.underline}

9\. Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the figure. Explain your choice of quadrants.

![](images/clipboard-398381974.png){fig-align="center" width="321"}

a\. SARS-CoV-2

[**Answer(9a):**]{.underline} Case 4-Potential Emerging Infectious Disease; There is typically a low between species transmission of the virus. Once in humans, SARS-CoV-2 had very high transmission human to human (within species transmission).

b\. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome

[**Answer:**]{.underline} Case 1-Spillover; Transmission of the disease requires high exposures of rodent feces, saliva, or urine. These events do not happen often and there has been no human to human transmission. Low between species transmission and low transmission within H2

c\. Langya Henipavirus

[**Answer:**]{.underline} Case 1-Spillover; Infection rates are due to repeated spillovers from shrews to humans, specifically near farms or rural areas. Transmission between humans is not sustained. Low transmission between species and low transmission within H2.

d\. Brucellosis

[**Answer:**]{.underline} Case 3-True multihost pathogen; High transmission between species, livestock into wildlife or humans, elk into bison. While human to human transmission is rather, the bacteria sustained in elk and transmitted to bison leads to intraspecies transmission (bison infect bison). Both within and between species transmission rates are high.

e\. WNV

[**Answer:**]{.underline} Case 1-Spillover; Mosquitoes blood feed on reservoir hosts, birds, who are infected and sometimes a human gets bit by mosquito with WNV. However, the virus doesn't sustain in humans, there is not enough viral loads. So humans are dead end hosts. Low between and within species transmission rates.

10\. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm *Anisakis simplex*. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers.

![](images/clipboard-3820788296.png){fig-align="center" width="485"}

[**Answer:**]{.underline}

-   Definitive host: Marine mammals; L3 larval infected crustaceans are ingested by a marine mammals. Once in the marine mammal, the parasite can reach full maturation and release new eggs by feces of the mammal.

-   Dead-end host: Humans; The parasite is not sustained in human populations. Humans are accidental host caused by ingestion of undercooked or raw seafish/cephalopods that are infected with L3 larvae. The parasite can't continue its life cycle (maturation and release eggs) any further once infecting a person.

-   Paratenic host: Seafish and Cephalopds; Become infected by eating a crustacean that has ingested L3 larvae. As a paratenic host there is not development taking place, these hosts pass on the larvae to the next animal that eats them (marine mammals for maturation, accidental hosts-humans).

-   Intermediate host: Crustaceans; Ingest L3 larvae once they hatch from the eggs. Marine mammals or seafish/cephalopods then eat the crustacean. The transmission to the next host is contributed by the crustacean. There may be some slight maturation of the parasite but not full sexual maturity.

11\. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples.

[**Answer:**]{.underline} This statement is false, infection does not always mean a host is diseased. Disease is defined as the impairment of normal functions. In some cases, pathogens invade hosts and simply survive within them, not causing any issues to the hosts. There are many examples of this, asymptomatic hosts, subclinical infections (carriers), or tolerant relationships. West Nile Virus in crows for example is often times very deadly to them, however majority of humans when infected show no disease at all and remain asymptomatic. As a reservoir for rabies, Big Brown Bats test positive for lyssaviruses at usually high viral loads. However, they show no neurological symptoms or other signs of disease. They are infected but their infection does not progress to any sort of disease, Big Brown Bats are tolerant to the virus. In CWD, cervids go through an extensive period of being infected but remain asmyptomatic while shedding prions. These are just a few of many, many examples, pathogens are able to persist and spread through various hosts without appearing diseased. Although, disease falls along the continuum of absolute health, which declines naturally with age. So even though infection does not equal disease, there could underlying issues that an infection may cause in the development of disease. It is still incorrect to state, "all infected hosts are diseased", diseases are much more complex than host + pathogen = disease.
