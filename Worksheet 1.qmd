**Integrating code and text:**

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

```

**Inserting Images:**

The image below is the epidemiological triad. This model is used to understand the complexity of infectious diseases. Rather than just explaining a disease as being the cause of a pathogen on the host, it involves the environment as a factor as well. Showing how the three factors (host, pathogen, and environment) interact to cause disease.

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

Answer 1) The sample size necessary to detect disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer is to sample from 59 deer.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer 2)

A\) To be 95% confident in detecting disease being 1% prevalent in a large population you would need to sample 299 animals within the overall population. This is for populations such as in the wild. If you have a better estimate of the total population size you would be able to determine a more clear sample size to test. For example if you wanted to be 95% confident the disease is prevalent at 1% in a population around 10000, you would need to sample 298 animals.

B\) To be 99% confident in detecting disease being 2% prevalent in a large population you would need to sample 229 animals within the overall population. This is for populations such as in the wild. If you have a better estimate of the total population size you would be able to determine a more clear sample size to test. For example if you wanted to be 99% confident the disease is prevalent at 2% in a population around 5000, you would need to sample 224 animals.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

Answer 3) Using the rule of 3's you can be 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in the facility is \<1%

**Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence**

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

![](images/clipboard-143554262.png)

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

Answer a):

-   On day 6/12: 5 new elk observed with RE, OD; 51 total susceptible...5/51= 0.098 cases per elk-day

-   On day 6/14: 2 new elk observed with RE, OD; 44 total susceptible...2/44= 0.045 cases per elk-day

-   On day 6/15: 0 new elk observed with RE or OD, so incidence of new cases is 0 cases per elk-day

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

Answer b):

-   On day 6/13: 13 elk are infected, the total population is 56...13/56= 0.214 so 23.2% prevalence of conjunctivitis

-   On day 6/16: 5 elk are infected, the total population is 56...5/56= 0.089 so 8.9% prevalence of conjunctivitis

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

Answer c):

-   6/10: Prevalence- 1/56= 0.18; Incidence- 0.18

-   No other days have the same prevalence and same incidence.

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest?

Answer d):

-   The days with the lowest incidence are days 6/15 & 6/16 with 0 new cases, followed by day 6/13 with 0.043 cases per elk-day

-   6/10: 1/56= 0.018

-   6/11: 4/55= 0.073

-   6/12: 5/51= 0.098

-   6/13: 2/46= 0.043

-   6/14: 2/44= 0.045

-   6/15: 0

-   6/16: 0
