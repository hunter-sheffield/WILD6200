**Inserting Images:**

The image below is the epidemiological triad. This model is used to understand the complexity of infectious diseases. Rather than just explaining a disease as being the cause of a pathogen on the host, it involves the environment as a factor as well. Showing how the three factors (host, pathogen, and environment) interact to cause disease.

![](images/clipboard-1758138076.png)

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

Answer 1) The sample size necessary to detect disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer is to sample from 59 deer.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer 2)

A\) To be 95% confident in detecting disease being 1% prevalent in a large population you would need to sample 299 animals within the overall population. This is for populations such as in the wild. If you have a better estimate of the total population size you would be able to determine a more clear sample size to test. For example if you wanted to be 95% confident the disease is prevalent at 1% in a population around 10000, you would need to sample 298 animals.

B\) To be 99% confident in detecting disease being 2% prevalent in a large population you would need to sample 229 animals within the overall population. This is for populations such as in the wild. If you have a better estimate of the total population size you would be able to determine a more clear sample size to test. For example if you wanted to be 99% confident the disease is prevalent at 2% in a population around 5000, you would need to sample 224 animals.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

Answer 3) Using the rule of 3's you can be 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in the facility is \<1%

**Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence**

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

![](images/clipboard-143554262.png)

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

Answer a):

-   On day 6/12: 5 new elk observed with RE, OD; 51 total susceptible...5/51= 0.098 cases per elk-day

-   On day 6/14: 2 new elk observed with RE, OD; 44 total susceptible...2/44= 0.045 cases per elk-day

-   On day 6/15: 0 new elk observed with RE or OD, so incidence of new cases is 0 cases per elk-day

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

Answer b):

-   On day 6/13: 13 elk are infected, the total population is 56...13/56= 0.214 so 23.2% prevalence of conjunctivitis

-   On day 6/16: 5 elk are infected, the total population is 56...5/56= 0.089 so 8.9% prevalence of conjunctivitis

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

Answer c):

-   6/10: Prevalence- 1/56= 0.18; Incidence- 0.18

-   No other days have the same prevalence and same incidence.

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest?

Answer d):

-   The days with the lowest incidence are days 6/15 & 6/16 with 0 new cases, followed by day 6/13 with 0.043 cases per elk-day

-   6/10: 1/56= 0.018

-   6/11: 4/55= 0.073

-   6/12: 5/51= 0.098

-   6/13: 2/46= 0.043

-   6/14: 2/44= 0.045

-   6/15: 0

-   6/16: 0

**Tick Identification Lab**

Tick identification follows the flow of life stage, sex, genus and then species. To start identification of the life stage (larva, nymph, or adult) you count the number of legs. Larvae have six legs, while nymphs and adults have eight. Sex is then determined by distinguishing the scutum, the back plate of ticks. Males have a full scutum covering the whole dorsal side (conscutum) while females have a smaller scutum (alloscutum). The alloscutum of females is smaller, so that it can expand while feeding. So, if you find a dog on a dog with a large expanded back it is either a female or nymph. Genus identification of ticks relies on the position of the anal groove. This groove in *Ixodes* is located in front of the anal opening, while most other ticks such as *Dermacentor* and *Amblyomma* have anal grooves that are behind the anus. Typically to determine species further, you would use a dichotomous key. However, the SAM method–scutum, anal groove, and mouthparts-provides a quick guide for reference. Longer mouthparts indicate species of *Amblyomma* species. While shorter mouthparts suggest the species will be *Dermacentor* or *Rhipicephalus.* Accurate tick identification is vital for public health. Ticks are the number one vectors for a variety of zoonotic diseases, such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Correctly identifying tick species aids public health in providing information to have vector control strategies in place and be better prepared to treat patients with tick borne infections.

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April 2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

![Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? *(If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)*](images/clipboard-1351626306.png)

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Incorrect; MERS-CoV is not primarily maintained in humans. Humans are incidental hosts that become infected through close contact with dromedary camels. It is only transmitted to humans through spillover events.
2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Correct, Camels are the main reservoir for MERS-CoV
3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Correct; Humans infected with MERS-CoV typically are not able to spread it to other humans. Although there has been limited documentation of human-to-human transmission, the virus does not efficiently sustain in human populations
4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Incorrect; the case fatality rate is around 35%
5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)
    -   [Answer:]{.underline} Incorrect; the epidemic curve shows this is propagated outbreak. There has been continuous transmission overtime, but most likely from different sources. Some may be linked to healthcare associated settings and close contact, while others are animal to human transmission.

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units. ​

​1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

[Answer:]{.underline} Based on the Fenton and Pedersen framework the Marburg virus outbreak can be classified as a spillover event then leading into an emerging infectious disease. To begin with, the outbreak began as a spillover event. It was transmitted from bats to one person who visited a bat cave, the Marburg virus naturally lives within bat populations but typically does not spread into humans. Once the first person was infected the virus had to the opportunity to spread from person to person, therefore becoming a potential emerging infectious disease.

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

[Answer:]{.underline} In the community measures implemented to reduce the risk of transmission would be public education of where the virus originates from. So explaining to people that being around bats or in enclosed areas where bats live (ex: the cave from where the Rwanda outbreak began) poses as a serious risk of being infected with Marburg. Another measure could be surveillance of bat populations to track how the virus is spreading and if it appears in locations not seen before. For healthcare settings, since the virus can spread from person to person via secretions having proper quarantined areas for patients with possible infection is a very important measure. It is also important for healthcare workers to wear proper PPE to prevent infections of themselves and proper hygiene practices, such as handwashing and ensuring areas patients come in contact with are disinfected (bedding, gowns, ect.).

## 11/10/2025-Worksheet #6

A new disease, *Vertico*, has been detected in fish in two separate ponds. Your task is to analyze the sample data to determine and compare the disease prevalence between the two ponds.

Data: Prevalence data for fish in 2 ponds: 0 indicates uninfected and 1 indicates infected fish.

<https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/blob/main/pond1_trial.csv>

<https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/blob/main/pond2_trial.csv>

For each pond, report the following: Prevalence (%), 95% CI (%), Fisher’s exact test *p*-value, and Interpretation (Is the difference statistically significant?).

**Pond 1:**

![](images/clipboard-1559762459.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Prevalence: 30%
2.  95% CI: 14%-53%

**Pond 2:**

![](images/clipboard-2694105833.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Prevalence: 6.7%
2.  95% CI: 3%-30%

**Pond 1 vs Pond 2 Prevalence using Fisher's exact test:**

![](images/clipboard-917827692.png){fig-align="center"}

Interpretation: From Fisher's exact test a p-value of 0.1987 is found. A p-value greater than 0.05 indicates the data from the two ponds is not statistically significant. The observed difference between the prevalence of *Vertico* in the two ponds (30% and 6.7%) is most likely due to random sampling variation of the fish rather than true differences in *Vertico* infection rates.

**Nipah Virus**

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

[**Answer:**]{.underline} In both countries fruit bats are the natural reservoir hosts. The mode of transmission in Malaysia is mediated through commercial pigs. Pigs became amplifying hosts of the virus, building up high viral loads which then began spreading through respiratory droplets specifically on farms. Humans cases typically were pig farmers, processing workers or others with exposure to pigs. In Bangladesh however, there is direct bat to human transmission and human to human. This transmission pathway is linked to the consumption of raw date palm sap that has been contaminated with the fruit bat urine or saliva. Human to human transmission is typically in close contact areas such as hospitals due to inadequate infection control procedures. Because the virus spreads via pigs in Malaysia it is important to have proper biosecurity measures, cull infected herds and ensure proper hygiene/PPE for farm and processing workers. Controlling the intermediate host (pigs) breaks the viral cycle and limits chances of human infections. In Bangladesh, prevention requires human behavior changes (consuming boiled rather than raw sap) and strengthening surveillance of human infections as well as healthcare hygiene.

**Avian Reovirus**

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

[**Answer:**]{.underline} Avian reoviruses spread rapidly among poultry flocks and wild bird populations through three routes: 1. Fecal-Oral: birds shed the virus in feces and other birds become infected by ingesting contaminated feed, water or litter; 2. Aerosols: the virus in dust particles or dried fecal matter get aerosolized and infect other birds which is very common in crowded poultry houses; 3. Vertical: infected hens can transmit the virus directly into the egg which results in infection of the chick before even hatching. There are several environmental factors that favor the transmission of ARV. Crowded poultry production houses increases fecal and aerosol spread, along with poor litter quality playing a role in this transmission. Flocks (or wild birds) sharing water sources can also be an efficient fecal oral transmission of the virus. Environmental stability of the virus plays a large role in its fecal-oral transmission, as it can persist in the litter, soil, and feces for weeks to months. ARV is a non-enveloped RNA virus, making it more resistant to disinfectants, drying, fluctuating temperatures, and acidic pH environments. One example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV is winter mortality in crows. During winter large numbers of crows gather together to roosts to provide them warmth, however this enhances the viruses ability to infect the birds and ultimately leads to a large number of crow deaths.

**Langya henipavirus**

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

[**Answer:**]{.underline} Current evidence shows the primary natural reservoir of LayV is shrews, with around 27% percent of shrews surveillanced showing high viral RNA associated with the virus. Humans are most likely to become infected with LayV through direct or indirect contact with the infected shrews. Most cases of human infections have been in farmers or individuals with frequent animal exposure. These patients most likely became infected from the bodily fluids of the shrews around their crops (saliva, urine, blood, feces). In rare cases, domestic animals (goats and dogs) have been a possible link from wildlife to human cases, however these cases are very few in number and the testing of the domestic animals showed low seropositivity for the virus. LayV is considered a zoonotic spillover and not an EID due to having no sustained human to human transmission. Currently, cases have all be sporadic and associated with certain geographical locations (on farms/rural areas in China). There has been no epidemiological clusterings of the virus in humans, even when patients are in close contacts with other members of their family, further suggesting humans as dead-end hosts.
